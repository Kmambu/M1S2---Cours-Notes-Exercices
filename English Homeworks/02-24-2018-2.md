### Paragraph 3
People think that being able to go through a day without enough sleep is something to be proud of. This lightens a real health issue. Most people are aware that not sleeping enough can cause various diseases. And the lack of prevention of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea increase the likeliness of developping one. But sleep does not only impact the body but the mind as well. Someone wou hasn't slept enough will be more likely to make poor decisions, be less emotionnaly balanced and less social.

### Paragraph 4
Scientists are now starting to understand the impact of sleep on health. The sleep can be divided in three stages : light sleep, Rapid Eye Movement and deep sleep. By using electrodes to measure the brain activity during sleep, scientists realised that while the first two stages present brain activity similar to that during the day, the signals during the brain activity of deep sleep are longer, as this is during this stage that the brain forges long-term memories and our body regenerates its cells.

### Paragraph 6
A German study showed that specific musical ambience during certain times of the sleep could help people sleep better. This improvement in sleep quality also improve the memory for the day to come. A research team at Penn State wanted to develop a system using this principle to improve sleep quality
